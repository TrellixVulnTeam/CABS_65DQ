#group,BASIC OPTIONS,Basic options allow to run protein flexibility simulation using only information about starting structure.,,,
"-S, --structure",STRUCTURE,"Loads structure.

STRUCTURE can be either:

1. PDB code (optionally with chain IDs)
i.e. '-S 1CE1:HL' loads chains H and L of 1CE1 structure downloaded from the PDB database

2. PDB file (optionally gzipped)",,,
,,,,,
#group,STRUCTURE OPTIONS,Structure options allows to manipulate the degree of protein flexibility (using either --structure-flexibility or --structure-restraints),,,
"-f, --structure-flexibility",FLEXIBILITY,"Modifies flexibility of selected protein residues:

0 - fully flexible backbone
1 - almost stiff backbone (default value, given appropriate number of structure restraints)
> 1 - increasing stiffnes

FLEXIBILITY can be either:

1. positive real number
all structure residues are assigned the same flexiblity equal that number

2. 'bf'
flexibility for each residue is read from the beta factor column of the CA atom in the pdb input file (Note that standard beta factor in pdb file has opposite meaning to CABSdock flexibillity, edit pdb accordingly or use FLEXIBILITY = 'bfi'),

3. 'bfi'
flexibility is assigned from the inverted beta factors in the input pdb file so that bf = 0.0 -> f = 1.0 and bf >= 1.0 -> f = 0.0

4. <filename>
flexibility is read from file <filename> in the format of single residue entries:

resid_ID <flexibility> i.e. 12:A 0.75
 
or residue ranges:

resid_ID - resid_ID <flexibility> i.e. 12:A - 15:A 0.75

Default value for residues not explicitely specified can be set by inserting at the top of the file a following line: default <default flexibility value>, if ommited default is 1.0.
Multiple entries can be used",1.0,,
"-R, --structure-restraints",MODE GAP MIN MAX,"Allows to generate a set of binary distance restraints for C-alpha atoms, that keep the structure in predefined conformation.

MODE can be either:

1. 'all' - generate restraints for all structure residues
2. 'ss1' - generate restraints only when at least one restrained residue is assigned regular secondary
 structure (helix or sheet)
3. 'ss2' - generate restraints only when both restrained residues are assigned regular secondary
 structure (helix, sheet)

GAP specifies gap along the main chain for two resiudes to be restrained
MIN and MAX are min and max values in Angstroms for two residues to be restrained",ss2 3 3.8 8.0,,
,,,,,
#group,RESTRAINTS OPTIONS,"Restraints options allows to set up distance restraints, either between C-alpha atoms (CA) or Side Chains (SC), where SCs are geometric centers of side chains atoms (as defined in CABS coarse-grained
model).",,,
--ca-rest-add,RESI RESJ DIST WEIGHT,"Add distance restraint between CA atom in residue RESI and CA atom in residue RESJ

DIST is a distance between these atoms and WEIGHT is restraint's weight from [0, 1].

Can be used multiple times to add multiple restraints.",,append,
--sc-rest-add,RESI RESJ DIST WEIGHT,"Add distance restraint between SC pseudoatom in residue RESI and SC pseudoatom in residue RESJ; DIST is a distance between these pseudoatoms (geometric centers of side chain atoms) and WEIGHT is restraint's weight from [0, 1]. Can be used multiple times to add multiple restraints.",,append,

#group,SIMULATION OPTIONS,Simulation options allow to modify different parameters of Replica Exchange Monte Carlo simulation procedure,,,

--mc-cycles,NUM,set number of simulation Monte Carlo cycles to NUM (NUM > 0) result trajectory will contain [mc-annealing] x NUM models,50.0,,int
--mc-steps,NUM,set number of Monte Carlo cycles between trajectory frames (NUM > 0) NUM = 1 means that every generated conformation will occur in trajectory. This option is independent from --mc-cycles and --mc-annealing. Total number of conformations generated for each replica = [mc-annealing] x [mc-cycles] x [mc-steps],50,,int
--replicas,NUM,set number of replicas to be used in Replica Exchange Monte Carlo,1,,int
--replicas-dtemp,DELTA,set temperature increment between replicas,0.5,,float
--temperature,TINIT TFINAL,"set temperature range for simmulated annealing TINIT - initial temperature, TFINAL - final temperature

CABSdock uses internal temperature units which do not correspond straightforwardly to real temperatures. T = 1.0 roughly corresponds to the temperature of the native state (crystal), folding temperature of small proteins in the CABS model is usually around T = 1.8 - 2.2",1.4 1.4,,float

#group,ALL-ATOM RECONSTRUCTION OPTIONS,"All-atom reconstruction options allow to set up details of all-atom reconstruction and refinement procedure, which is performed using MODELLER package",,,
