description,"CABSdock application is a versatile tool for molecular docking of peptides to proteins. It allows for flexible docking (also with large-scale conformational changes) and without knowledge about the binding site. CABSdock enables peptide docking using only information about the peptide sequence and the protein receptor structure. In addition to this input data, many advanced options are available that allow for manipulation of a simulation setup, a degree of protein flexibility or guiding the peptide binding etc.

CABSdock method has been first made available as a web server [Nucleic Acids Research, 43(W1): W419-W424, 2015; web server website: http://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/CABSdock]. The standalone application version [submitted to publication] provides the same modeling methodology equipped with many additional features and customizable options.",,,,

i.e. -p HKILHRLLQD:CHHHHHHHHC 

loads HKILHRLLQD peptide sequence with the secondary structure assignemnt: CHHHHHHHHC

HINT: If possible, it is always recommended to use secondary structure information/prediction. For residues with ambiguous secondary structure prediction assignment it is better to assign coil (C) than the regular (H - helix or E - extended) type of structure.

#group,RECEPTOR OPTIONS,Receptor options allows to exclude some receptor residues from docking search and to manipulate the degree of protein receptor flexibility (using either --flexibility or --receptor-restraints options),,,
"-e, --exclude",RESIDUES,"Exculdes receptor residues listed in RESIDUES from the docking search, therefore enforces more effective search in other areas of a receptor surface,

for example, it may be known that some parts of the protein are not accessible to peptide (due to binding to other proteins) and therefore it could be useful to exclude these regions from the search procedure

RESIDUES can be a comma-separated list of: residue numbers with chain ID, residue ranges with chain ID, chain ID's 

i.e. -e 12:A, 15:A-30:A, chain B 

allows to exclude residue 12th from the chain A, all residues from 15th to 30th from the chain A and all residues of the chain B

",,,"12:A, 15:A - 17:A,  chain B"
"-f, --flexibility",FLEXIBILITY,"Assigns a degree of flexibility to protein residues:
0 - fully flexible backbone
1 - almost stiff backbone (default value, given appropriate number of receptor restraints, see --receptor-restraints option, value 1 allows for )
> 1 - increasing stiffnes

FLEXIBILITY can be either:

1. positive real number
all receptor residues are assigned the same flexiblity equal that number

2. 'bf'
flexibility for each residue is read from the beta factor column of the CA
atom in the pdb input file (Note that standard beta factor in pdb file has
opposite meaning to CABS-dock flexibillity, edit pdb accordingly
or use FLEXIBILITY = 'bfi'),

3. 'bfi'
flexibility is assigned from the inverted beta factors in the input pdb file
so that bf = 0.0 -> f = 1.0 and bf >= 1.0 -> f = 0.0

4. <filename>
flexibility is read from file <filename> in the format of single residue entries:

resid_ID FLEXIBILITY i.e. 12:A 0.75
 
or residue ranges:

resid_ID - resid_ID FLEXIBILITY i.e. 12:A - 15:A  0.75

"-R, --receptor-restraints",MODE GAP MIN MAX,"Allows to generate a set of binary distance restraints for C-alpha atoms, that keep the receptor in predefined conformation.

MODE can be either:

1. 'all' - generate restraints for all receptor residues
2. 'ss1' - generate restraints only when at least one restrained residue is
assigned regular secondary structure (helix or sheet)
3. 'ss2' - generate restraints only when both restrained residues are
assigned regular secondary structure (helix, sheet)

GAP specifies gap along the main chain for two resiudes to be restrained

MIN and MAX are min and max values in Angstroms for two residues
to be restrained",all 5 5.0 15.0,,ss2 5 3.14 6.66

    Peptide will be placed above the geometrical center of listed
    residues at distance defined by the '-s, --separation' option
